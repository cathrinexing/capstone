      <p>User experience (UX) is an approach to product development that incorporates direct user feedback throughout the development cycle (human-centered design) in order to reduce costs and create products and tools that meet user needs and
        have a high level of usability (UXPA).</p>
        <img class="rightal" src="img/nng.png" alt="" width=200px>
          <p>UX is User experience and “User experience” encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products(Nielsen Norman Group).</p>
            <img class="rightal" src="img/usabilitygov.png" alt="" width=200px>
          <p>User experience (UX) focuses on having a deep understanding of users, what they need, what they value, their abilities, and also their limitations.  It also takes into account the business goals and objectives of the group managing the project. UX best practices promote improving the quality of the user’s interaction with and perceptions of your product and any related services.</p>

            <img class="rightal" src="img/Hass.jpeg" alt="" width=200px>
      <p>A consequence of a user’s internal state (predispositions, expectations, needs, motivation, mood, etc.), the characteristics of the designed system (e.g. complexity, purpose, usability, functionality, etc.) and the context (or the environment) within which the interaction occurs (e.g. organisational/social setting, meaningfulness of the activity, voluntariness of use, etc.)(Hassenzahl & Tractinsky (2006))</p>
