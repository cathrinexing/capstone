<h3>What is the process of creating this project?</h3>

<p>I started my process of identifying as many as UX related graduate programs as many as possible in the U.S. from precedents. Finally, 33 programs were identified. Then I continued to interview potential students about factors they consider when they choose a program and the ranking of the factors. After analyzing interview results, I created a Google sheet to collect my data from program's websites and used my data to design a filter programs section and a general overview section.</p>
<p>Moreover, I posted survey on social media to ask UX professional mainly about their job title as well as skills or courses they consider useful.  After using "affinity diagramming" and "fly on the way observation" to analyze my data from survey, I identified two main kinds careers: designer and researcher. Then I added these two career pathes as the first level option in my filtering function, and I ranked the programs by the number of courses that UX professionals consider useful.</p>
<h3>Hope you enjoy the process of identifying your desired program !</h3>
