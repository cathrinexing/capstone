<h3>What is the process of creating this project?</h3>

<p>I started my process of identifying as many as UX related graduate programs as many as possible in the US from precedents. Finally, 33 programs were identified. Then I continued to interview potential students about factors they consider when they choose a program and the ranking of the programs, in order to creating a filter function and a general overview. After analyzing interviews results, I created a Google sheet to collect my data from programs website and used my data for my further filter section and the general overview section.</p>
<p>Moreover, I posted survey on social media to ask UX professional mainly about the job title as well as the skills or courses they consider useful.  After using affinity diagram to analyze my data from survey. Two main kinds careers, designer and researcher, are identified. Then I added the the career path as the first option in my filtering function. </p>
<h3>Hope you enjoy the process of identifying your desired program !</h3>
